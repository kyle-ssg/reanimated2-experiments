# React Native Reanimated 2 Experiments

The aim of this repository is to create a set of animated / interactive components that conform to the following rules:

- Run on the UI layout without JS blocking
- Expose a configurable animationValue from 0 to 1 to support interpolation with your other components
- Fully customisable stylistically
- Interuptable, meaning that values can be set during an animation


Long term the aim is to release this as an NPM module, however React Native Reanimated 2 is still new and in beta.
